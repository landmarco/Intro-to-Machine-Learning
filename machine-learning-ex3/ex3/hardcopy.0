  1 function [J, grad] = lrCostFunction(theta, X, y, lambda)
  2 %LRCOSTFUNCTION Compute cost and gradient for logistic regression with
  3 %regularization
  4 %   J = LRCOSTFUNCTION(theta, X, y, lambda) computes the cost of using
  5 %   theta as the parameter for regularized logistic regression and the
  6 %   gradient of the cost w.r.t. to the parameters.
  7
  8 % Initialize some useful values
  9 m = length(y); % number of training examples
 10
 11 % You need to return the following variables correctly
 12 J = 0;
 13 grad = zeros(size(theta));
 14
 15 % ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
 16 % Instructions: Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta.
 17 %               You should set J to the cost.
 18 %               Compute the partial derivatives and set grad to the partial
 19 %               derivatives of the cost w.r.t. each parameter in theta
 20 %
 21 % Hint: The computation of the cost function and gradients can be
 22 %       efficiently vectorized. For example, consider the computation
 23 %
 24 %           sigmoid(X * theta)
 25 %
 26 %       Each row of the resulting matrix will contain the value of the
 27 %       prediction for that example. You can make use of this to vectorize
 28 %       the cost function and gradient computations.
 29 %
 30 % Hint: When computing the gradient of the regularized cost function,
 31 %       there're many possible vectorized solutions, but one solution
 32 %       looks like:
 33 %           grad = (unregularized gradient for logistic regression)
 34 %           temp = theta;
 35 %           temp(1) = 0;   % because we don't add anything for j = 0
 36 %           grad = grad + YOUR_CODE_HERE (using the temp variable)
